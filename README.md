Java Online Banking System
A console-based banking application developed in Java. This system demonstrates core programming concepts including File I/O, Object-Oriented Programming, and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations by managing user data through a flat-file database.
🚀 Features
•	User Registration: Create a new banking account with a unique username, password, and initial balance.
•	Secure Login: Authentication system that validates credentials against stored user data.
•	Account Operations:
o	View Balance: Real-time balance inquiry using account numbers.
o	Deposit: Add funds to an existing account.
o	Withdrawal: Remove funds with built-in validation for insufficient balances.
o	Transfer: Move funds between two different account numbers.
•	Data Persistence: All user information and account balances are saved in users.txt to ensure data is kept after the program closes.
🛠️ Technical Implementation
•	Language: Java
•	Storage: Text-based file handling (FileReader, FileWriter, BufferedReader, BufferedWriter).
•	Logic:
o	Home.java: The entry point of the application.
o	Transfer.java / Deposit.java / Withdrawal.java: Use temporary files (tempUsers.txt) to safely update account balances without data loss.
📁 File Structure
•	src/: Contains the Java source files (Home.java, Login.java, CreateAccount.java, etc.).
•	users.txt: The primary "database" file where user records are stored.
•	tempUsers.txt: Used for intermediate processing during transactions.
